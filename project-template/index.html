    Under the Sea takes on the life of a jellyfish, seen aimlessly wandering in search of food. 
    The connotation of the jellyfish’s actions is dependent on the user—where it may appear trapped in an endless cycle, 
    or calmly swimming around. Regardless of the user’s interpretation of the jellyfish, 
    this piece is created with a calming effect in mind. 
    Through the repetition of movement and the integration of cool, light colors, 
    Under the Sea holds therapeutic attributes.
